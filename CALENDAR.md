# Silverware Games – Living Calendar

This is a **living, non-strict calendar** for Silverware Games.

It does not represent fixed dates, deadlines, or daily output expectations.  
Instead, it documents the **recurring rhythms** of how work actually happens here.

Work at Silverware Games is:
- Bursty
- Iterative
- Multi-disciplinary
- Driven by momentum, not a clock

This page exists to set expectations for collaborators, not to enforce a schedule.

## How to Read This Calendar

- Entries describe **patterns**, not specific days
- Some weeks are quiet, others are highly productive
- Output often arrives in clusters rather than steady daily commits
- Public silence often means private progress

Progress is real even when it isn’t visible.

## Common Work Rhythms

### Game Development

Occurs in focused bursts:

- Prototyping new mechanics or mini-games
- Iterating on existing games (design, balance, UI, feel)
- Writing or updating GDDs and README files
- Refactoring or cleaning older code
- Shipping or updating HTML5 builds

Commits tend to arrive in groups rather than on a daily streak.

### GameDev Feedback (YouTube)

Happens when a game is ready for thoughtful review:

- Recording gameplay and commentary
- Analyzing UI/UX, onboarding, and clarity
- Editing short, opinionated feedback videos
- Publishing to YouTube
- Updating the GameDev Feedback issue queue

Some weeks include multiple videos.  
Some weeks include none.

### Art & Doodles

Appears organically:

- Marker drawings and sketchbook work
- Timelapse recordings
- Digital cleanup or formatting
- Short-form video exports

Art output is intentionally unforced and mood-driven.

### Video & Content Experiments

Occurs opportunistically:

- Short-form videos (memes, clips, reactions)
- AI experiments and surreal edits
- Parody concepts and fake trailers
- One-off creative tests

Not every experiment ships. That is intentional.

### Podcasts & Long-Form Conversations

Occasional and intentional:

- Guest-hosted podcast episodes
- Design discussions
- Creative process conversations

These happen when the right people and energy align.

### Client Work

Runs alongside internal projects:

- Website builds
- Creative direction
- Technical consulting
- Design and implementation sprints

Client work may temporarily reduce public output while still being highly productive.

## What This Calendar Is Not

- Not a promise of daily posts
- Not a content quota
- Not a productivity scoreboard

Silverware Games values:
- Sustainable creativity
- Enjoyment of the process
- Shipping work that feels good to make

## For Collaborators

If you are contributing:

- Do not expect daily commits
- Do expect honest progress
- Momentum often arrives in waves

If things look quiet, something is usually cooking.

## Summary

Work gets done here.  
Just not on a fixed schedule.

If that works for you — welcome.
