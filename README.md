1) "Play More Games Button" for HTML5 Games for people who want to try our other stuff, redirects to https://silverwaregames.com/games/
2) Remove all SWGIO.com backend for now. To be improved later.
3) ~~Add google stats to all games so that we can see how many people are playing.~~
4) Add "games" pinned article to silverwaregames.com front page that redirects to https://silverwaregames.com/games/
5) Add "Mailing List Sign Up Button" Make sure https://list.silverwaregames.com goes to a mailing list sign up and plaster the link around everywhere.
6) Fix "Press" page so it is correct and doesn't use the weird vlambeer system that is bad.
7) ~~Make https://silverwaregames.com/games/ an attractive site with little thumb/buttons for each of my best game projects.~~
8) ~~Remove stats bar at bottom of silverwaregames.com because backend is dead for now. (See 2)~~
9) Redirect https://silverwaregames.io to https://silverwaregames.com for now.
