**Silverware Games** is an independent game studio, creative playground, and collaborative hub focused on making games, art, and weird ideas fun for everyone involved.

This repository serves as:
- A centralized roadmap for Silverware Games projects
- A coordination hub for collaborators
- A public-facing snapshot of what we’re building, publishing, and experimenting with

Our unofficial mission statement:  
**Make cool things, invite good people, and bring the fun.**

## What We Do

Silverware Games works across multiple creative lanes:

- Original games (HTML5, PC, console)
- Experimental art & interactive media
- Podcasts and video series
- Client work and consulting
- Open collaboration with artists, developers, and creators

Some projects are playful.  
Some are polished.  
Many are intentionally strange.

## 🎮 GameDev Feedback Series

[<img width="1280" height="640" alt="GDFThumb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/064c22a5-e97d-4d6f-b653-b8c85b7f1d7e" />](https://github.com/Silverware-Games/Gamedev-Feedback/)


Silverware Games produces a GameDev Feedback video series focused on giving meaningful, honest feedback to indie games that are still in development. This is part of our mission to support other creators, highlight great work, and help devs polish UI/UX, gameplay clarity, and feature design.

This series is open, supportive, and constructive:
- We review submitted games on our YouTube channel.
- Feedback covers areas like usability, design clarity, potential features, and overall player experience.
- We aim to help games become more understandable and fun for broader audiences.

Check out the repo for [Gamedev Feedback](https://github.com/Silverware-Games/Gamedev-Feedback/)

## Podcasts & Guest Content

We host and guest-host podcasts and long-form creative conversations on YouTube.

These include:
- Design discussions
- Art process breakdowns
- Game dev feedback
- Creative philosophy
- Occasionally unhinged tangents

Episodes are intentionally informal and creator-friendly.  
If you like talking shop and making things — you’re welcome.
