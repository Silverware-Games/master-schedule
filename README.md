1) "Play More Games Button" for HTML5 Games for people who want to try our other stuff, redirects to https://silverwaregames.com/games/
2) Remove all SWGIO.com backend for now. To be improved later.
3) Add "games" pinned article to silverwaregames.com front page that redirects to https://silverwaregames.com/games/
4) Add "Mailing List Sign Up Button" Make sure https://list.silverwaregames.com goes to a mailing list sign up and plaster the link around everywhere.
5) Fix "Press" page so it is correct and doesn't use the weird vlambeer system that is bad.
6) Redirect https://silverwaregames.io to https://silverwaregames.com for now.
