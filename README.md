# Silverware Games, Inc.

**Silverware Games** is an independent game studio, creative playground, and collaborative hub focused on making games, art, and weird ideas fun for everyone involved.

This repository serves as:
- A centralized roadmap for Silverware Games projects
- A coordination hub for collaborators
- A public-facing snapshot of what we’re building, publishing, and experimenting with

Our unofficial mission statement:  
**Make cool things, invite good people, and bring the fun.**

## What We Do

Silverware Games works across multiple creative lanes:

- Original games (HTML5, PC, console)
- Experimental art & interactive media
- Podcasts and video series
- Client work and consulting
- Open collaboration with artists, developers, and creators

Some projects are playful.  
Some are polished.  
Many are intentionally strange.

## Games Hub

Our public games page lives here:  
https://silverwaregames.com/games

It features a curated selection of our best and most representative work.

**Rate:** $60/hour
